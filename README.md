### Day 1:
- In this joint program between MIT and SureStart, I am hoping to advance my knowledge in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, as well as other applications of Data Science. At the beginning of the program we cover the fundamentals of python programming for Machine Learning with all necessesary packages, including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. For the rest of the program we are going to build a Deep Learning project in a team of other students.
