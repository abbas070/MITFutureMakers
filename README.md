## Responses:

### Day 1:
- In this joint program between MIT and SureStart, I am hoping to advance my knowledge in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, as well as other applications of Data Science. At the beginning of the program, we cover the fundamentals of python programming for Machine Learning with all necessary packages, including pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. For the rest of the program, we are going to build a Deep Learning project in a team of other students. 

### Day 2:
- On the second day of our program, we had a seminar on leadership & storytelling held by a Director of MIT Media Lab, Dr. Kong. In this session, we covered the importance of storytelling and self-recognition. As a result, this session has taught me not only a better storytelling strategy, but also gave me a sense that we all had our struggles in life and all deserve respect for staying strong and not giving up.

### Day 3:
- On day 3 we had an opportunity to learn about some concepts and models of machine learning and applications of scikit-learn. We learned about the bone structure of Artificial Intelligence and its sub-categories, such as Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning. There are two main components of Machine Learning that produce final predictions - a dataset (this includes data wrangling with raw data) with which we will feed the model and an algorithm (this includes data splitting, training, and validating models) which will compute prediction.

### Day 4:
 - For day 4, our task was to find a dataset that could solve a real-world problem. The problem that I was interested in was understanding the user-base in businesses such as Spotify and finding out how to maximize the efficiency of their software to propose possible improvements. Questions such as do people cluster certain artists on one playlist, does having more playlist followers increase or reduce the average listen time, and what variables lead to the longest listening time can be answered while exploring the dataset.
