# MITFutureMakers
The MIT FutureMakers Create-a-thon is a virtual and part-time AI learning program build in collaboration between [SureStart](https://mysurestart.com/) and [MIT Riase Initiative](https://raise.mit.edu/), which is responsible for AI social empowerment.

In this program, we focused on:

- [x] Learning AI, machine learning and deep learning concepts
- [x] Turning skills into confidence through building AI solutions hands-on
- [x] Consistent support and encouragement from a mentor 1-1
- [x] Regular tech talks and career readiness seminars from industry authorities
- [x] Entrepreneurship and leadership skills development

For the first month of the program, I have learned fundamental knowledge on machine learning and deep learning and was able to apply this knowledge to numerious hands-on projects. Along with that, we were introduce to market research principles to make sure we are solving a real-world problem when creating our final project. To build our product, we went through several iterations and at the end had an opportunity to patent our work.

At the end of the program we had a create-a-thon where together with my team I was able to develop an application that would be able to recognize face features using face recognition. When our application with an integrated deep learning model was completed, we presented it to the panel of judges that would determine our placement among other teams and eligibility of completion the program. As a result, my team was ranked as the finalist team. [All projects that I worked on during this program is here.](#all-projects)

## Day 1:
### ***What do you hope to learn from this program?***
- In this joint program between MIT and SureStart, I am hoping to advance my knowledge in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, as well as other applications of Data Science. At the beginning of the program, we cover the fundamentals of python programming for Machine Learning with all necessary packages, including pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. For the rest of the program, we are going to build a Deep Learning project in a team of other students. 

## Day 2:
### ***What did you learn during Dr. Kong's seminar?***
- On the second day of our program, we had a seminar on leadership & storytelling held by a Director of MIT Media Lab, Dr. Kong. In this session, we covered the importance of storytelling and self-recognition. As a result, this session has taught me not only a better storytelling strategy, but also gave me a sense that we all had our struggles in life and all deserve respect for staying strong and not giving up.

## Day 3:
### ***Lesson Plan***
- Reviewed ML models with this [article](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer)
### ***Action Item:*** 
- [Decision Tree Classifier](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/blob/main/decision_tree_classifier.ipynb)
### ***What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?***
| Supervised Learning                                                                      | Unsupervised Learning                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ***Use Cases:***<br>Predict outcomes for new data                                        | ***Use Cases:***<br>Gain insights from large volumes of data                                             |
| ***Applications:***<br>- Spam Detection<br>- Sentiment Analysis<br>- Pricing Predictions | ***Applications:***<br>- Anomaly Detection<br>- Recommendation Engines<br>- Medical Image Classification |
| ***Drawbacks:***<br>Can be time-consuming to label dataset and train models              | ***Drawbacks:***<br>Can have inaccurate results and reflects biases that might be present in the dataset |

### ***Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.***
The Scikit-Learn library is built on top of visualization libraries like Pandas and Graphviz. Therefore, data analysis libraries need to be installed prior to using Scikit-Learn.

### ***Supplemental Activity:*** 
- [Predicting Housing Prices](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/blob/main/predicting-housing-prices.ipynb)

- On day 3 we had an opportunity to learn about some concepts and models of machine learning and applications of scikit-learn. We learned about the bone structure of Artificial Intelligence and its sub-categories, such as Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning. There are two main components of Machine Learning that produce final predictions - a dataset (this includes data wrangling with raw data) with which we will feed the model and an algorithm (this includes data splitting, training, and validating models) which will compute prediction.

## Day 4:
### ***Lesson Plan***
- Gained a high level understanding of DL models and algorithms through [this article](https://serokell.io/blog/deep-learning-and-neural-network-guide)
### ***Real World Problem:*** 
According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/falls), an estimated 684 000 fatal falls occur each year, making it the second leading cause of unintentional injury death, after road traffic injuries. However, not all falls are fatal, with 37.3 million falls being severe enough to require medical attention. With so many people being injured or killed each year by falls, it is of great social significance to provide them with accurate, dependable, and effective procedures to mitigate the effects of falls. 

### ***Dataset:*** 
I am using the [SisFall dataset](http://sistemic.udea.edu.co/en/research/projects/english-falls/) which consists of data collected from two accelerometers and one gyroscope. This dataset is the only one I could find that includes falls by people over 60. However, due to medical concerns, there is a bias towards younger groups of people.

### ***Method:*** 
I'm currently developing a model to detect falls using deep learning, which will be deployed to an Arduino. The binary classification model uses a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for time series prediction. 

The biggest hurdle I am facing is the low processing power of the Arduino. I managed to train a model that can detect falls with over 99.5% accuracy, though the computation requirements for feature extraction proved to be too high for the Arduino to handle. I have therefore switched to using deep learning and am training the model on raw data. More information on the project can be found here: [https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/tree/main/fall-detection](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/tree/main/fall-detection)

### ***Supplemental Activity:*** 
- Read this [article](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/) on the difference between AI and ML.

 - For day 4, our task was to find a dataset that could solve a real-world problem. The problem that I was interested in was understanding the user-base in businesses such as Spotify and finding out how to maximize the efficiency of their software to propose possible improvements. Questions such as do people cluster certain artists on one playlist, does having more playlist followers increase or reduce the average listen time, and what variables lead to the longest listening time can be answered while exploring the dataset. The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks

### Day 5 and 6:
- The Weekend

### Day 7:
### ***Lesson Plan:*** 
- [TensorFlow Basics](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/blob/main/tensorflow-basics.ipynb)
- [Belgian Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/blob/main/traffic_signs_classification.ipynb)
- [Wine Identification](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/blob/main/wine-identification.ipynb)

### ***What are "Tensors" and what are they used for in Machine Learning?***
- This day, we have learned about tensors and their value in machine learning. Mathematically speaking, Tensors are data containers, ranging from scalar to 3D matrixes, so a tensor is a container that can house data in N dimensions.  Tensors can be thought of as objects in an object-oriented sense, rather than just as data structures, from a computer science perspective. As for machine learning, tensors is a term and a set of techniques used in machine learning to describe the training and operation of deep learning models.

![Difference between a scalar, a vector, a matrix and a tensor](/images/scalar-vector-matrix-tensor.png "Difference between a scalar, a vector, a matrix and a tensor")

Tensors usually contain numerical data and are the backbone of neural networks. All transformations of a neural network can be reduced to tensor operations.

### ***What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?***
The datasets had to be processed before training the model so that it could better identify the relationships between the data. This process is called feature extraction or feature engineering.

## Day 8:
- On this day we got to practice simple neural network models. The task was to detect sarcasm in the news dataset.

### ***Lesson Plan:*** 
- Reviewed [this guide](https://serokell.io/blog/deep-learning-and-neural-network-guide) about common components of neural networks and how they work with different ML functions and algorithms. 
### ***Action Item:*** 
- [Sarcasm detection](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/blob/main/sarcasm_detection.ipynb)

## Day 9:
### ***Lesson Plan:*** 
- Learned about CNNs using this [cheatsheet](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-convolutional-neural-networks)
- [Visualized](https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/flat.html) how CNNs work with handwritten digits
- [What is a confusion matrix?](https://machinelearningmastery.com/confusion-matrix-machine-learning/)
- Our main task was to extend the dataset for a CNN model to notice differences

### ***Action Item:*** 
- [MNIST Digits Classification](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/blob/main/mnist-digit-classification.ipynb)

## Day 10:
### ***Lesson Plan:*** 
- Reviewed [presentation](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1194/slides/cs224n-2019-lecture19-bias.pdf) on algorithmic bias

### ***Action Item:***
- Played [survival of the best fit](https://www.survivalofthebestfit.com/) to learn more about how AI might impact human resources and hiring processes in different fields

### ***How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game?***
After playing "Survival of the Best Fit" game on ethical problems with AI and hiring, I have learned on how algorithmic basic occurs and possible ways to prevent it. The game itself was designed well, with implementation of both software engineering and machine learning (AI). After each step of completing the game, there was a series of questions to answer, and the game would proceed with the option that we choose and then adapt to our results.

### ***Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, and equitable? Please reflect on why you selected this specific biased model.***
A real-world example that seems to be very common is COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) algorithm that is used in US court systems to predict the likelihood that a defendant would become a recidivist. For prevention of bias, a richer dataset must be used for training machine learning algorithm.

## Day 11:
### ***Lesson Plan:*** 
- Reviewed [CNN Architecture](https://towardsdatascience.com/convolutional-neural-networks-explained-9cc5188c4939)

### ***Action Item:*** 
- Improved [MNIST Digit Classification](https://github.com/abbas070/MITFutureMakers/blob/main/mnist-digit-classification.ipynb) algorithm and added option to make predictions in the notebook
- A fully connected neural network is made up of a sequence of fully linked layers, each of which connects every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the other. One of the advantages of fully connected networks is that they are “structure agnostic” which means that there is no special assumptions needed to be made about the input. CNN networks, on the other hand, use the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, allowing the model architecture to encode specific features.

## Day 12 and 13:
- The Weekend

## Day 14:
### ***Lesson Plan:*** 
- Read [article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-choose-loss-functions-when-training-deep-learning-neural-networks/) on choosing loss functions
- Watched [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7iBpEHGVNc) and reviewed [slides](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2017/cs231n_2017_lecture3.pdf) on loss functions and optimization

## Day 15:
### ***Lesson Plan:*** 
- Reviewed [article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/choose-an-activation-function-for-deep-learning/) on choosing activation functions
- Learned [how to implement the ReLU activation function](https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/)

### ***Choosing an activation function for a hidden layer***
![Choosing an activation function for a hidden layer](/images/activation-function-hidden.png "Choosing an activation function for a hidden layer")

### ***Choosing an activation function for an output layer***
![Choosing an activation function for an output layer](/images/activation-function-output.png "Choosing an activation function for an output layer")

- We have learned about different functions applied to deep learning. One of the most common functions used for hidden layers is a Rectified Linear Activation (ReLU) function, which is calculated by max(0.0, x). It is not just simple to implement, but also effective at overcoming the limitations of other functions. ReLU function is less susceptible to vanishing gradients that prevent deep models from being trained.

### ***What are some advantages of the Rectified Linear activation function? State a use case.***
The ReLU has become the most used activation function for hidden layers.The function is simple to use and efficient at overcoming the drawbacks of earlier popular activation functions such as sigmoid and tanh. It is less prone to vanishing gradients, which prohibit deep models from being trained, however it can suffer from other issues such as saturated or "dead" units.

The ReLU activation function can be used in hidden layers for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks.

## Day 16:
### ***Lesson Plan:***
